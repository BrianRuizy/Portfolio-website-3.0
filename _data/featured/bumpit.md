## The Challenge

The main objective of the competition revolved around developing innovative solutions for improving the infrastructure of cities. The [Smart Infrastructure Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smart-infrastructure-hackathon-tickets-76918610635#) was hosted at The Cannon, in partnership with Microsoft. Thankfully, we had a team of really bright cloud architects for guidance.

After brainstorming and juggling several ideas we settled with the issue of road potholes. We found that potholes cost American drivers $6.4 billion dollars per year, that is in both repair and insurance cost's. Additionally, the average price to repair a pothole including labor is about $30 - $50 per pothole, while the damage that single pothole may cause are up to $300/year per vehicle. (2016) [pothole.info](https://www.pothole.info/2016/05/so-many-potholes-so-much-cost/)  Thus the effort to aiding this issue can be extremely cost-effective.

## Our Proposal

The idea of the application to be a simple as possible to minimize driving distractions. Therefore, we intended to create an interface that would show a dialog box only when our system predicted there to be a pothole, from there the user would confirm if so. Also, we designed for a 2-layer confirmation of a road pothole, one by the active camera, and secondly using either the user's phone telemetry data.

### Mobile telemetry

Every modern smartphone is equipped with very accurate telemetry systems. For instance the GPS and accelerometer, which we leveraged for location and to track any abrupt movement indicating a pothole on the road. One of the difficulties with this approach was that logging every high acceleration movement may result in false positives of a road pothole. Hence why we would need a second layer of confirmation, using computer vision ML.

## The Result ðŸ¥‡

Having won the competition, post minimum-viable-product, granted us full access to MS Azure cloud infrastucture. Which we will employ for the future continued development of the application*.
