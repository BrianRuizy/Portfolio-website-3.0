## About

ðŸ¥‡ **Bump.IT** | *Pothole detection and mapping*,  1st Place winners (tie)<br/>
Hackathon competition partnered with [The Cannon](https://thecannon.com/), Houston TX.

Bump.IT is a solution to the issues costing American drivers **$6.4 billion** dollars per year, that is in both repair and insurance cost's. Additionally, the average price to repair a pothole including labor is about **$30 - $50** / pothole, while the damage that single pothole may cause are up to **$300** /year/vehicle. Thus the effort to fixing the affected roads is extremely cost-effective.

Having won the competition, post minimum-viable-product, granted us full access to MS Azure cloud infrastucture. Which we will employ for the future continued development of the application.
