## About 
This is the third version of portfolio websites that I've made and one I'm proud of, given that I had to self-teach myself web development. Though, proud, never satisfied. I believe it's important to always find areas to improve in, for ones' own personal growth...

This site features:  
* Responsive web design, optimized for tablets and mobile devices. 
* Minimalist flat custom project cards.
* An entirely CSS, MacOS style window pane with embedded links.
* A horizontal timeline depicting events, implemented in JS.
* <del>Lava background gradient that changes with time, implemented in JS*. may evolve to parallax effect.<del>
* **New** entirely CSS based live-gradient effect. Layered with particles-js background effect.

Improve upon and style it to your taste! Cheers.
