Web Development - 3rd iteration of my personal Software Development portfolio website, featuring a animistic UI/UX &amp; responsive design.

## About 
This is the third version of portfolio websites that I've made and one I'm proud of, given that I had to self-teach myself all to do with web development; since it's a subject that is untouched in University CS programs. Though, proud, never satisfied. I believe it's important to always find areas to improve in, for ones' own personal growth.

ðŸ˜Ž Feel free to use as a template for your own site, and style it to your taste! Cheers.
